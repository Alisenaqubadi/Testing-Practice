# Testing Practice

This project is a collection of utility functions and their corresponding tests. It is designed to demonstrate the use of JavaScript testing frameworks and best practices for writing testable code.

## Features

### Functions

1. **capitalize**
   - Converts the first character of a string to uppercase.
   - Throws an error if the input is not a string or is empty.

2. **reverseString**
   - Reverses the characters in a string.
   - Throws an error if the input is not a string or is empty.

3. **calculator**
   - A simple calculator object with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Throws an error if inputs are not numbers or are empty.

4. **caesarCipher**
   - Encrypts a string using the Caesar cipher technique.
   - Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.
   - Throws an error if the input is not a string or the key is not a number.

5. **analyzeArray**
   - Analyzes an array of numbers and returns an object containing the average, minimum, maximum, and length of the array.

### Tests

- Comprehensive test cases are written for each function to ensure correctness and handle edge cases.
- The tests use the Jest framework.
